    <h2>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently a programmer analyst at SFG in Big Sandy, TX. My job is to build RPG <em>(Report Program Generator)</em> programs. 
      I spend most of my free time learning and expanding my skills. I hope that I will someday achieve my dream job of becoming a software engineer.
      I am highly artistic and highly logical. I welcome any who would like to build up a friendship with me.
    <h3>These are my top 5 interests</h3>
